# employee-directory
A React application that allows employers to view their whole directory of employees with information in one place.

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
  
Some quick bullet points about the WK 19 HW 
• Single page application with a React front-end only
• You can use Classes or Hooks
• Deployed to GitHub pages and not Heroku. (We’ll start the full MERN stack deployed to Heroku next week).
• Page loads a table of x amount of employees
• Table renders non-sensitive employee information
• An example API that returns 200 random users: https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&nat=us
• You can search via an input field that will filter down the list of users and re-render the list of employees onChange (Only one category required for filtering)
• You can also click on a column header and sort the entire list ascending or descending based on the column you click (Only one category sort is required)
• The solution has five columns but it’s up to you on how many and what columns. Columns used: Image of employee, Name, Phone, Email, Date of Birth
